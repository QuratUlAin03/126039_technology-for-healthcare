<big><big><h2> What are emotional support animals</h2>

<p>An emotional support animal is an animal companion that offers some type of benefit to an individual with some form of disability. The animal is intended to provide companionship and support that will help alleviate at least one aspect of the disability.

Dogs are the most common type of emotional support animal, but cats are quite common as well. Other types of animals, such as miniature horses, can also serve as ESAs.<br>

For example, a peacock made headlines after it was denied from entering a United Airlines flight, despite the fact that its owner said that the animal was an emotional support animal. Some of the more unusual emotional support animals that have flown with their owners include a pig, a duck, a monkey, and a turkey. The vast majority of ESAs are not rare, exotic, or barnyard creatures.<br></p>

<h2>  What are service Dogs </h2>
<P>Service animals are working animals that have been trained to perform tasks that assist disabled people. Service animals may also be referred to as assistance animals, assist animals, or helper animals depending on the country and the animal's function.<br>

Dogs are the most common service animals, assisting people in many different ways since at least 1927.</P><hr>

<p class="p">The Cavalier King Charles spaniel is like a living stuffed animal. These dogs love to cuddle and typically have a friendly temperament. They're often referred to as the “comforter spaniel.” They're usually just as happy to cozy up with their favorite humans as they are to join them for a pleasant walk.</p></li>

<li> <h3>German Shepherd</h3>
<img src="g.webp" class="img"></img>
<p class="p">German shepherds prefer to have a job, which is why they’re often chosen as working dogs.

And with sufficient training, they can become wonderful companions in public spaces.</p></li>

<img src="C.JPG" class="img"></img>
<p class="p">If you are just not a dog person, you can make a cat into an emotional support animal. Cats can be loving and playful family members to their humans and even other animals. While they cannot be trained as a service animal, cats can become outstanding emotional support animals with housing and flying rights.</p></li>

<h2>Who is a motivational speaker?</h2>
<P>A motivational speaker, also known as an inspirational speaker, is someone who delivers speeches with the intention of motivating or inspiring the people in the audience. Typically, he or she has a reputation as an expert on the subject being discussed, and will encourage the audience to look at things from a different perspective and to become more attentive to their own talents and abilities.
The ultimate goal of a motivational speaker is to change people profoundly on an emotional and/or mental level, and to help them make some kind of professional or personal change in their lives and within themselves. People naturally tend to focus on all their problems, and the motivational speaker will help an audience to focus on the many opportunities instead, by using any number of persuasive speech tactics to inspire and motivate. </P>
