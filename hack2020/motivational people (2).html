<h2>Who is a motivational speaker?</h2>
<p>A motivational speaker, also known as an inspirational speaker, is someone who delivers speeches with the intention of motivating or inspiring the people in the audience. Typically, he or she has a reputation as an expert on the subject being discussed, and will encourage the audience to look at things from a different perspective and to become more attentive to their own talents and abilities.
The ultimate goal of a motivational speaker is to change people profoundly on an emotional and/or mental level, and to help them make some kind of professional or personal change in their lives and within themselves. People naturally tend to focus on all their problems, and the motivational speaker will help an audience to focus on the many opportunities instead, by using any number of persuasive speech tactics to inspire and motivate. </p>
